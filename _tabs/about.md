I am a PhD student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln studying safe and trustworthy reinforcement learning and machine learning advised by Stephen Scott. My research touches on verification, interpretability, generative models, self-supervised learning, and applications including materials science, chemistry, robots, computer security, and medicine.

A great deal of my work has focused on the intersection of theory and application, with work experience at NASA and Microsoft Research, as well as working contributing to projects at the University of Nebraska Medical Center and the NIMBUS lab at UNL.

I'm currently a Research Scientist at a startup called [Phaidra](https://www.phaidra.ai/). We do RL in the industrial space, which I believe has incredible potential to improve efficiency and combat climate change. Please feel free to contact me regarding any kind of collaboration or interest in what I do.
