I am a PhD student at University of Nebraska-Lincoln studying safe reinforcement learning and explainable deep learning advised by Stephen Scott. I've interned at Microsoft Research and AI in Redmond in Summers 2019 and 2020 and NASA in Summer 2021. I expect to graduate soon and will be on the job market.
