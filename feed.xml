Optimal Brain Damage (LeCun et al., 1989) The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: Finding Sparse, Trainable Neural Networks (Frankle &amp;amp; Carbin, 2018) posited that, at initialization, neural networks contain sparse subnetworks that can train in isolation to full accuracy.

I’ve been a programming language nerd since dabbling with Haskell and the like in undergrad, and I’m very interested in the whole area of “proving things about computation”. Naturally, this falls squarely into that intersection, so I’m going to be following along with the course as best ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>An Intro to Star Sets</title><link href="https://drkwint.github.io/posts/starsets/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="An Intro to Star Sets" /><published>2021-09-21T00:00:00-05:00</published> <updated>2022-11-01T23:32:56-05:00</updated> <id>https://drkwint.github.io/posts/starsets/</id> <content src="https://drkwint.github.io/posts/starsets/" /> <author> <name>Eleanor Quint</name> </author> <category term="Tutorials" /> <summary> The star set, introduced in (Tran et al., 2019), is a construction that is central to my work right now, so I wrote up this tutorial to help explain it in a simple, motivated way to my collaborators. I’m sharing it here now for my students, and so that I have something to which I can direct the curious. (Note: this post is a work in progress, expect it to change) Motivation Star sets are a v... </summary> </entry> </feed>
